## Model 13. Autocorrelated Lognormal Distribution {.unnumbered}

The autocorrelated lognormal distribution provides a parametric model for stochastic recruitment generation with serial correlation. *The autocorrelated lognormal distribution model does not depend on spawning biomass and is time-dependent.*

The autocorrelated lognormal distribution is

$$
\begin{split}
& n_r(t) = e^{s_t}\\
& \\
& where\ \varepsilon_t = \phi\varepsilon_{t-1} + w_t \ with \ w_t \sim N \left(\mu_{log(r)} \cdot \sigma^2_{log(r)}\right) \\
& and\ R(t) = c_R \cdot n_r(t)
\end{split}
\tag{33}\label{eq:33}
$$

The lognormal distribution parameters $\mu_{log(r)} \cdot \sigma^2_{log(r)}$,$\phi$, $\varepsilon_0$ as well as the conversion coefficient for recruitment $C_R$ are specified by the user. It is assumed that the parameters of the lognormal distribution have been estimated in relative units $r(t)$ and then converted to absolute values with the conversion coefficient.
